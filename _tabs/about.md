Hey, I’m gr0bot
I’m just a curious noob learning how to break things. My main obsessions? Active Directory and anything that involves red teaming.

When I’m not chasing vulnerabilities, I’m usually chasing Kyubi, my Shiba Inu and full-time chaos agent. You’ll probably spot him here on the blog occasionally, because he loves to “help” by walking on my keyboard and creating exploits I didn’t even think were possible.

See you around!
