Hello friend, you can call me gr0bot. 
I’m curious about learning how to break things. My main obsessions? Windows, Active Directory, Web and anything that involves red teaming. I work as a pentester in a french company.

When I’m not chasing vulnerabilities, I’m usually chasing Kyubi, my Shiba Inu and full-time chaos agent. You’ll probably spot him here on the blog occasionally, because he loves to “help” by walking on my keyboard and creating exploits I didn’t even think were possible.

See you around!
